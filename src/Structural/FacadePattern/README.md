# Facade Patterns
This repository contains examples and explanations of the Facade pattern used in software development.

In this example, we have two Calss - FileManager and ImageConvertor - which provide different functionalities. The Facade class acts as an interface for the client to access these subsystems in a simplified way. The client interacts only with the Facade class and does not need to know about the internal workings of the subsystems.

The Facade class creates instances of the subsystems and provides a single ConvertImageFileToText() that calls the relevant methods of the subsystems in the required sequence. The client only needs to call this single method to perform the required operations.

This implementation demonstrates the key features of the Facade pattern - it provides a simple interface for the client to interact with complex subsystems and hides the complexity of the subsystems behind a simplified interface.

## Introduction
The Facade pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, objects, or subsystems. The Facade pattern is often used to make the interface of a library or framework easier to use.
This repository aims to provide an overview of various types of Facade patterns, along with examples of how they can be used in practice. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, you can benefit from learning about Facade patterns and how to apply them in your projects.

## How Facade Pattern Works
The Facade pattern works by providing a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, objects, or subsystems. The Facade acts as a single entry point to the system, hiding the complexity of the underlying subsystems and providing a simpler and more user-friendly interface.
The Facade pattern is often used to provide a unified interface to a library or framework, making it easier for developers to use and reducing the complexity of the system. By using the Facade pattern, developers can focus on the high-level functionality of the system, without worrying about the low-level details.

## Types of Facade Patterns
There are various types of Facade patterns, such as:
 * Single Facade: A single class that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
 * Multiple Facades: Multiple classes that work together to provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
 * Nested Facades: Multiple layers of Facades that work together to provide a simplified interface to a complex system.
This repository will cover various examples of each of these types of Facade patterns.

## How to Use this Repository
Each type of Facade pattern is described in a separate directory. Inside each directory, you will find an example of how the pattern can be used in practice, along with a detailed explanation of its benefits and limitations.
You can clone this repository to your local machine and explore the different Facade patterns. You can also use the examples as a starting point for your own projects, or to gain a better understanding of how to apply Facade patterns in practice
